# Python Bot

This is the simplest example of using Anderson.

Just run the following command:
```bash
anderson "python3 main.py" ./gifs ./config.yaml
```

**Note**: You need to have the `JetBrains Mono` font in your system in order for the GIFs to be generated. 
You can download the font [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/). 
You can also change the font in the config to any other font that is installed in your system.

In the `gifs` folder you will get the following gifs:
- `light.gif`: 
  ![light.gif](gifs%2Flight.gif)
- `dark.gif`:
  ![dark.gif](gifs%2Fdark.gif)
